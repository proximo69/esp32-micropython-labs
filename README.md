# ESP32 MicroPython Lab Series

Hands-on experiments and applied learning projects using the **ESP32 microcontroller** and **MicroPython**.  
This repository documents my personal study journey through embedded systems — beginning with foundational exercises based on *Programming the ESP32 with MicroPython* and expanding into custom lab experiments, timing analysis, and integrated hardware projects.

---

## 🌱 Project Overview

The goal of this series is to **learn by building**.  
Each lab explores a specific concept in embedded programming — GPIO control, input handling, pulse generation, timing accuracy, or peripheral interfaces — and demonstrates it through working code, circuit diagrams, and logic analyzer data.

As my studies progress, the repository will evolve beyond the textbook into independent experiments that support larger systems such as my **AutoAg** (autonomous agriculture) and **Weather Station** projects.
