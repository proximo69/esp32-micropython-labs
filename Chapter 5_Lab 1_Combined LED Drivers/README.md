# Chapter 5 ‚Äì Lab 1: Combined LED Driver Test  
*Programming the ESP32 with MicroPython ‚Äì Section 1 Final Lab*

---

## üéØ Objective

This lab combines two independent LED driver circuits ‚Äî one using a **BJT transistor** and the other using a **MOSFET** ‚Äî into a single coordinated test program.

It demonstrates **modular programming**, **timing control**, and **safe execution** using MicroPython‚Äôs `time` and `machine` modules.  
By running both drivers in sequence, the ESP32 produces visible and measurable pulse streams that can be verified on a logic analyzer.

## üß† Concepts Reinforced

| Concept | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Modular Design** | Separate Python files (`bjt_driver.py`, `mosfet_driver.py`, `main.py`) form a clean, reusable structure. |
| **Class-Based Hardware Control** | Each driver encapsulates pin configuration and on/off logic. |
| **Timing & Scheduling** | Uses `time.sleep_ms()` and `time.ticks_ms()` for precise control of pulse intervals. |
| **Exception Handling** | `try / except / finally` ensures outputs always return to a safe OFF state. |
| **Testing & Verification** | Output signals are captured in **PulseView** using a logic analyzer for waveform analysis. |

## ‚öôÔ∏è Materials

- **ESP32 Development Board** (WROOM or similar)  
- **Breadboard and jumpers**  
- **NPN BJT transistor** (e.g., PN2222, 2N3904)  
- **Logic-level N-MOSFET** (e.g., IRLZ44N or IRL540N)  
- **Two LEDs** (different colors)  
- **Current-limiting resistors** (220‚Äì330 Œ© typical)  
- **Two pushbuttons** *(optional for future lab extensions)*  
- **Logic Analyzer + PulseView software**

## üß© File Overview

| File | Purpose |
|------|----------|
| **bjt_driver.py** | Defines the `BjtDriver` class to control a low-side NPN transistor LED circuit. |
| **mosfet_driver.py** | Defines the `MosfetDriver` class to control a logic-level MOSFET LED circuit. |
| **main.py** | Coordinates both drivers, applying precise timing, an arming delay, and safe cleanup. |

---

## üîç Program Behavior

1. **Imports drivers and time module.**  
2. Defines an **arming delay** (10 s) to allow the user to prepare PulseView.  
3. Executes a **one-shot window** (10 s total) where:  
   - The BJT LED driver pulses first.  
   - A short **phase gap** separates the two signals.  
   - The MOSFET LED driver pulses second.  
4. Each cycle repeats at a defined **period** (200 ms default).  
5. On completion or manual interruption (Ctrl-C), all outputs return to the OFF state.

---

## üßÆ Timing Diagram (Conceptual)
|<--------- PERIOD_MS = 200 ms --------->| [BJT ON 50 ms] [GAP 10 ms] [MOSFET ON 50 ms] [REMAIN 90 ms idle]

Measured on PulseView, this produces distinct, non-overlapping square waves at the chosen cycle period.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Configuration Parameters

Defined at the top of `main.py`:

| Variable | Default | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| `START_DELAY_S` | 10 | Seconds to wait before pulses begin (arming time). |
| `RUN_TIME_S` | 10 | Total run duration in seconds. |
| `PERIOD_MS` | 200 | Period between starts of each test cycle. |
| `ON_MS_BJT` | 50 | Duration of the BJT ON pulse. |
| `ON_MS_MOSFET` | 50 | Duration of the MOSFET ON pulse. |
| `GAP_MS` | 10 | Delay between the two pulses each cycle. |
| `BJT_PIN` | 16 | GPIO output for the BJT circuit. |
| `MOSFET_PIN` | 17 | GPIO output for the MOSFET circuit. |

## üß∞ Usage Instructions

1. **Upload all three files** to the ESP32:
   - `bjt_driver.py`  
   - `mosfet_driver.py`  
   - `main.py`
2. **Connect the circuits** as shown in your breadboard layout.  
3. **Start PulseView** and arm the logic analyzer on the BJT and MOSFET input pins.  
4. **Run the program**:
   ```python
   >>> import main
5. Observe the countdown messages in REPL during arming delay.


6. Capture and analyze pulses in PulseView.


7. After completion, verify that both LEDs are off.

**Operation:**  
When GPIO16 outputs HIGH, base current flows through the 1 kŒ© resistor into the BJT base, turning it ON and allowing current to flow through the LED ‚Üí resistor ‚Üí collector ‚Üí emitter ‚Üí GND.  
When GPIO16 goes LOW, the transistor switches OFF and the LED turns off.

### ‚öôÔ∏è MOSFET LED Driver (N-channel, logic-level)

3.3V ‚îÄ‚îÄ[220Œ©]‚îÄ‚îÄ‚ñ∂‚îÇ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îê
                     ‚îÇ
                     ‚îÇ LED (green)
                     ‚îÇ
                 Drain
                    ‚îÇ

                    ‚îÇ
               Source ‚Üí GND

**Operation:**  
When GPIO17 outputs HIGH (~3.3 V), the MOSFET gate voltage rises enough to switch it ON, allowing current to flow through the LED.  
When GPIO17 goes LOW, the MOSFET switches OFF and current stops.

> üí° *In practice, a small 100 Œ© gate resistor can be added between GPIO17 and the MOSFET gate for noise suppression, though not strictly required in low-speed tests like this.*

üîí Safety and Recovery

If interrupted (Ctrl-C), the finally block ensures all GPIOs are set LOW (OFF).

The main.py file prevents infinite loops ‚Äî it is always safe to upload and re-run.

Using non-boot-strap pins (GPIO 16, 17) prevents ESP32 startup issues.
